# Project Overview (Restaurant Review)

In this Restaurant Review project, students are given a static webpage to be converted to all media-friendly web application.The original application lacks modern web features such as accessibility,responsiveness and able to load offline. Therefore the purpose of the project is to make the project responsive, and also to comply with accessibility requirement. The application should also use the capabilities of service worker to load the page during offline.
